# Patreon Supporter Fetcher
 This repository contains a minimalistic web application that fetches and displays a list of Patreon supporters sorted by their membership tiers. The application is built using JavaScript and the Patreon API. The website consists of a simple landing page, a supporters page, a privacy policy page, and a terms of service page. Please note that this application is designed for demonstration purposes and should be further modified and secured before deploying it in a production environment.
